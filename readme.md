>**Important**: A new repository has been created for hands-on exercies for AI-900 to reflect a major refresh for the course. Going forward, please use the [mslearn-ai-fundamentals](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-fundamentals). We will retire this repository before the end of the calendar year. 

This repository contains the hands-on lab exercises for Microsoft course [AI-900 *Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/courses/ai-900t00) and the [self-paced modules on Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals).
